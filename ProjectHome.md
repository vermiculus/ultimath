A C++ library of functions that use mathematical formulas to evaluate data. Currently working on string parser to take mathematical strings such as "(2x+5y(2^8x))/z" and evaluate them for values of x, y, and z. Doing so will not only allow for custom formulae, but will create a macro to evaluate standardized formulae, such as the quadratic equation or other concrete functions.

As of October 2, 2010, the numerical processor is complete. All that remains is substitution, which should be fairly simple... I take that back :)
