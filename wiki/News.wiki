#summary The latest news on Ultimath

I have added a C# project for the express purpose of prototyping and testing. I know C# is by no means cross-platform, but for our purposes it will work fine. The final, C++ version will indeed be cross platform, but we need to perfect our algorithm first. C# -> C++ is much easier than English -> C++. 

I have also revolutionized the parser with conceptual help from WindowsDevPro, and I truly hope HE WILL ACTUALLY START CONTRIBUTING CONCRETELY :)

Instead of going character by character, we now 'tokenize' the string much the same way a compiler does. As we go through the string, we split it into Arg_Part structs (a string value and a type). This is not only easier to understand, but will ultimately end up being faster design-time AND run-time. Too many loops are bad for the heart.
